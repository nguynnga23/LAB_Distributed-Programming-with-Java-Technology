//1. The first approach for creating threads is implement Runnable interface (recommended)
public class YourTask implements Runnable {

	private String taskName;
	private int counter;
	
	
	public YourTask(String taskName, int counter) {
		this.taskName = taskName;
		this.counter = counter;
	}

	@Override
	public void run() {
		for(int i = 0; i < counter; i++) {
			System.out.println("taskName" + "#" + i);
		}
	}
}
